Predicting Stroke Risk with Machine Learning: Prioritizing Early Detection
This project leverages the power of machine learning (ML) to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of suffering a stroke in the near future. The primary focus of this project is on maximizing recall, meaning we aim to correctly identify the highest possible percentage of true stroke cases, even if it means potentially including some false positives.

Here's a breakdown of the project:

Project Goals:

Develop a robust ML model that accurately predicts the probability of an individual experiencing a stroke within 
a defined timeframe.
Prioritize model training to achieve high recall, ensuring the model is highly sensitive to identifying potential stroke cases.
Investigate and implement suitable ML algorithms for time-to-event analysis and probability prediction, such as survival analysis models or recurrent neural networks.
Identify and utilize relevant features from patient medical history, demographics, lifestyle factors, and potentially genetic information for accurate prediction.

Project Significance:

Early stroke detection is crucial: Timely intervention significantly reduces the risk of long-term disability and mortality associated with strokes.
A high-recall model can act as an effective screening tool: Identifying high-risk individuals enables proactive medical intervention and lifestyle modifications to mitigate stroke risk.
The project can contribute to the advancement of personalized medicine: By identifying individual risk factors, tailored prevention strategies and treatment plans can be developed.
Project Deliverables:

A fully trained and validated ML model capable of predicting stroke risk within a specific timeframe.
A detailed report outlining the model development process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation metrics.
This project has the potential to significantly impact public health by providing a valuable tool for early stroke detection and prevention. The emphasis on recall ensures that the model prioritizes identifying individuals at risk, empowering healthcare professionals to take proactive measures and potentially save lives.
